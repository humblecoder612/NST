# Neural Style Transfer
> ML/AI applied to transfer art-style 
We use a content image and a style image. Then, we write an algorithm to generate a new image, where the algorithm basically tries to retain some features from the content image and apply the style from the style image. So, we get our content image sort of stylized in the style of this style image. This can give some really cool results. This technique was proposed by L.A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge. They wrote a paper called A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style back in 2015.
